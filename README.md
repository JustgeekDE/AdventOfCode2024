My solutions to AdventOfCode 2024

I'm trying to use many different languages (ideally a new one each day). This usually results in not very optimal code. Also since there is a time element to solving these puzzles, often my solutions are not that polished.

Most could probably benefit from another pass of refactoring. Removing unecessary comments, log statements, misleading variable names, ....

Sometimes to solve the second part of a problem I will modify the code that was used to solve the first part. In those cases there should always be a commit in the history with the version that was used to solve the first part.
